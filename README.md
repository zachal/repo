# Zachal’s SimplifyMyi App Repo
 —- Currently available to iOS 8.4 users only. You may attempt on the systems, but there is no guarantee as to it’s functionality/reliability, and this may break your iPhone.

# Simplify My i —
>>> Simplify your i(Phone/Pad/Touch/Whatever), removing all the “Stock” apps you don’t ever use.
>> SimplifyMyi by default removes all your stock apps except Messages, Phone, and App Store (but don’t worry it caches them unless you tell it otherwise). What is removed is configurable too. 
Each of the apps is then re-downloadable via the app (or Cydia). For each app there are two options: User, or Root app; User apps being deletable via the x on Springboard, and Root apps being how they were originally installed (the latter is much more reliable as certain apps won’t work). The rest is pretty simple.

Enjoy!
